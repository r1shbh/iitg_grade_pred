# IITG Student Grade Prediction Project

## About Dataset:

```
A flagship project by Consulting & Analytics Club of IIT Guwahati (India) to
understand the relation between the grades of a first year student at IIT
Guwahati with their previous background and their activities at the campus.
The project was aimed to help the next batch of incoming freshers to better
prioritize their activities at campus.
The data was collected via door-to-door survey collection in all hostels by
representatives of C&A Club evenly to allow for data collection in all hostels.
An online survey was avoided to have no fake information to be input by the
students.
The anonimity of each survey taker was taken care of.
